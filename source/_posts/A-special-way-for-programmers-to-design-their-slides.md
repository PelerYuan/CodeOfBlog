Yesterday I was making slides for the lecture in Chinese lessons. I always confused by something about designing, but yesterday I found a new way to do it.

![an example](https://ice.frostsky.com/2024/04/05/820ad577ac2b8d91eedf666494a6bfff.png)

Just set background color to black, and add something like HTML tags in the context, it will create a sense of relating to technologies.
