Today I was wondering if that I can make a website as the clone of my QQzone so that not only my Chinese friends but also some international friends can access it and see my posts.

As well, I searched on Google and find this amazing project <https://github.com/wwwpf/QzoneExporter>. I forked it and undefinately it worked well!

And it also support to generate a website by flask, but the website's style was duplicated from the official QQzone so of course it's a little bit out dated.

Next step I gonna try to design a website by myself, hope I will be success.

Thanks to GitHub and the anthor of this project!
