Today's evening I changed my avatar, in the suggestions from one of my classmates.

I think the old avatar, from my dog, is fine. But some people told me that it is wired or they were surprised when saw it for the first time. I have to say it may be true, cause I took that photo and I know the situation, but others don't.

Just for record.
